# BreakTheWall
Stuck with a **mandatory workplace wallpaper** on your Windows laptop that youâ€™d love to replace?

This repo offers a loophole to personalize your desktop background, allowing you to choose your wallpaper while keeping within policy boundaries and without needing admin rights! **Yaay ðŸŽ‰**

*Say goodbye to the default and make your workspace truly yours! :")*

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. If you don't have git installed, you can download the zip file and extract it. *(If this is the first time you're working with `PowerShell` scripts, save the script in your `Documents` directory.)*
1. Store your desired wallpaper as `wallpaper.jpg` in the `Downloads` directory
> **Note - 1:** The script currently supports only `.jpg` files. If you have a different format, you can convert it to `.jpg` using an online converter, and the name must follow the format `wallpaper.jpg`.

> **Note - 2:** If you're unsure about the location of `Downloads` directory, you can find it opening `File Explorer` and typing `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads` in the address bar.
1. Run the `BreakTheWall.ps1` script by right-clicking on it and selecting `Run with PowerShell`. (For pro-users, you can also run it from the `PowerShell` terminal, but make sure to navigate to the script's location first.)

**That's it! Your wallpaper should now be updated to the one you saved! <3**
